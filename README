The data for the application statistics is being regularly collected in several locations.
These scripts collect the information, clean the data and produce csv files with the statistics.

There are three stages to generate the statistics:

1. Set time period required in "config"
2. Run "./get-pbsreport" as root on wlm01
3. Run "./generate-application-statistics" as a normal user somewhere "module load R" works.
