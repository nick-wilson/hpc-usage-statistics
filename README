The data for the application statistics is being regularly collected in several locations.
These scripts collect the information, clean the data and produce csv files with the statistics.

To generate the statistics use the following procedure:

    cp config.example config
    # edit config with correct dates and settings
    make

This will do the following:

1. Run pbs-report over date range specified in config as root on wlm01 (uses ssh if username or hostname is not correct)
2. Clean output to correct for any "|" characters in job names and to remove header and footer lines
3. Count the number of cores used by each job (gpu nodes always counted as 24 cores) in a csv file
4. Collect application information in a csv file
5. Collect information about all users who submitted jobs in a csv file
6. Run R scripts to generate statistics
