The data for the application statistics is being regularly collected in several locations.
These scripts collect the information, clean the data and produce csv files with the statistics.

There are three stages to generate the statistics:

1. Set time period required in "config"
2. Run "./get-pbsreport" as root on wlm01
3. Run "./generate-application-statistics" as a normal user somewhere "module load R" works.

The "get-pbsreport" can take a lot of time to run, particularly if there lots of jobs in the report.
The slow step is a shell script which cleans up the output of pbs-report and calculates core-hours.
